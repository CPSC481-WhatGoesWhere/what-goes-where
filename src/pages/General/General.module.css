/* MetalDisposal.module.css */


/* 
  Below is an exemple of how to set-up css for this module:

    - The css class ".exemple {}" is an exemple class.
      If it were to be used it would have to be used in 
      a manner like so "<div className={styles.exemple}>".

    - You can see how to set-up the variable, the variables
      can be found in the @/pages/Layout/Layout.module.css
      in the ":global(:root) {...}" class.
      You may add more variables there, but remeber that 
      changing them will alter things globally.

    - Make sure that you use a lot of components in the Page,
      since its a Page rather than a Component, this css file 
      should be pretty bear of things and only hold a few things.
      Components have lots of styling and require lots of css
      but Pages mainly hold components.

    - Make sure that none of the css classes in this css stylesheet
      are to be used for Components, this css stylesheet is for the 
      Page only. Css classes for components can be stored in their 
      respective css stylesheets.
